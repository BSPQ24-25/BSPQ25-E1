```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the application starts, open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8080
The application should now be running and accessible.

## âœ… Running the Tests

This project includes three types of tests: unit, integration, and performance. Use the following commands depending on the test type:

Unit Tests: 80 % coverage according to JaCoCo
```bash
mvn test
```


Integration Tests:  
```bash
mvn clean verify -Pintegration
```

Performance Tests:
